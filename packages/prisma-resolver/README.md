# @prisma-to-graphql/prisma-resolver

A GraphQL resolver implementation that uses a Prisma Client to run CRUD operations. Used by [`prisma-to-graphql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma-to-graphql) to implement its generated resolvers.

This isn't particularly designed to be used outside of [`prisma-to-graphql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma-to-graphql), but it is here if you wish to do so.
